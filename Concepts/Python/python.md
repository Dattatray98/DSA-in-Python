# Python Programming Language 

# Let's Start with Python :

  ## What is Python?
    - python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
    - That means :
      a) You write instruction in English-like words.
      b) The Python interpreter executes them line by line.
  
  ## What are variables? 
      - A variable is named box in memory that stores data.
      > Example :
        a) Name on a jar in kitchen
        b) If you name jar as "sugar" and you put sugar inside it, that exactly what a variable does.
        c) How to create a variable
           a = 5        --> here we created a variable and named as "a" and we stored a value 5.
           b = "hello"  --> here we created a variable and named as "b" and we stored a value "hello".

      - That's how we can create and assign values to the variable.
      - After assigning or creating a variable we can use these variable in our further programme and functions.


  ## What are Data Types?
      - Every value in python has type, it tells python what kind of data is.
      - when create a variable and stores some value, here the value has a data type, which can be string, int, bool etc.
      
      > Data Types in Python :
        
        Data Type                           Example Values                          Use Case 

          int                                  10, -5                           Counting/indexing

          float                                2.42, -1.34                      Decimal Numbers

          bool                                 True, False                      Decision making

          string                               "hellow"                         text or words

          list                                 [1,2,3,4,5]                      Group of items

          tuple                                (1,2,3,4,5)                      fixed group

          set                                  {1,2,3,4,5}                      unique items
        
          dict                                 {"name":"Jony"}                  Key-value pairs

      
      - The given are some data types which are widely used in python.


  ## Input and output :
      >> Input : 
        - it is used to take data from user.
        - Think of it asking a question.
        - For input we use function  -->> input()

      >> Output : 
        - it used to show data to the user.
        - Think of it is a answer to the question.
        - For output we use function  -->> print()
      
  ## Operators :
      - Operators are used to perfor a specific operations like subtraction, addition, multiplication, etc.
      - There are four types of operators as given below :
  
           Type                             Symbol                              Example
    
        Arithmetic                      + - * / % ** //                     Add, subtract, multiply, divide

        Comparison                      > < == != >= <=                     Compare two values

        Logical                         and, or, not                        Combine conditions

        Assignment                         = += -=                          Store or update values


  ## Conditional Statements :
      - Conditional statements are the statements which are used to make decisions in a program
      - These statements helps to control the flow of execution.
      - It make decision based on whether specified condition is True or False.
      >> Examples of conditional statements :
        > if-else, elif (else if), else
  

  ## Loops :
      - Loops are the control flow statements that repeatedly executes the block of code until a specific condition is met or for each item in a sequence.
      - The automates the repeative task efficiently.
      - Python supports two primary types of loops and several control statements :
        a) for Loop
        b) While loop
